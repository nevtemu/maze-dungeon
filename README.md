# Maze and dungeon generator
Originaly inspired by [Path of exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/ "Official game website") [delve](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Delve "Path of exile game wiki - Delve")  endless dungeon with randomly generated passes and biomes.    
### Algorithm   
I've built it around __cells IDs__ containing X and Y coordinates, forming a grid of set size.
I created algorithm myself, but I found it very similar to [depth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search "Depth first search") algorithm.      
Did minimum design. Mostly was interested in algorithm itself. Current styles are based on CSS variables and grid layout. Later I want to implement biomes generation for different parts of the maze (where most styles will be applied).     
I added small validation at the end based on `Set()` collection property that elements are unique (not repeated).   
        
This is few end results for normal maze:

Maze with some cells blocked (number of blocked cells can be tweaked):     
<img src="./src/_maze_blocked-cells.png" width="420px"/>     
Maze with extra doors (more like dungeon style):     
<img src="./src/_maze_extra-doors.png" width="420px"/>     
     
### Settings
Maze settings (size, blocked cells, extra passages) set in constants at the start of the script.    
Note: if making changes to the size - require CSS variables changes in styles.css file too to render correctly.
